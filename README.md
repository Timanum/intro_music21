# Introduction to MIT music21

This repo contains a few notebooks that introduces the basic functions of the MIT music21 package.

### What to do from here:

1. Search within music21 corpus for data that are:
    - composed by Mozart
    - contain only piano
    *** modify these requirement accordingly
    
2. Explore the data objects in music21 to find an appropriate text format that can be read by the LSTM model.

3. Encode the data into a suitable tensor that can be fed into the LSTM model.

Please refer to existing projects by OpenAI and projects presented at today's (4 Oct 18) meeting.

Have fun!
