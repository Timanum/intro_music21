# Introduction to MIT music21

This repo contains a few notebooks that introduce the basic functions of the MIT music21 package.

Before you start with anything, please install music21 using this guide:  
http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/usersGuide/usersGuide_01_installing.html

### What to do from here:

1. Search within music21 corpus for data that are:
    - composed by Mozart
    - contain only piano
    - *** modify the above requirement accordingly
    
2. Explore the data objects in music21 to find an appropriate text format that can be read by the LSTM model.

3. Encode the data into a suitable tensor that can be fed into the LSTM model.

Please refer to existing projects by OpenAI and projects presented at today's (4 Oct 18) meeting.

Have fun!
